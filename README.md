# PhotoViewer
A (very) basic photo viewing app written in Python 3 using Tkinter and PIL.

# About
This application runs on python using libraries like tkinter and PIL for loading images and scrolling through them. The folder/image destination has to be put into the code for it to display the images. The application works by displaying the first image and proving a **Previous** and **Next** option to scroll through the images present in the destination folder provided.
